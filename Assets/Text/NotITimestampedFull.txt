she
similarly
eight
months
later
almost
to
the
tick
so
no
love
spared
that
no
love
such
as
normally
vented
on
the
speechless
infant
in
the
home
no
nor
indeed
for
that
matter
any
of
any
kind
no
love
of
any
kind
at
any
subsequent
stage
so
typical
affair
nothing
of
any
note
till
coming
up
to
sixty
when-
good
coming
up
to
seventy
wandering
in
a
field
looking
aimlessly
for
cowslips
to
make
a
ball
a
few
steps
then
stop
stare
into
space
then
on
a
few
more
stop
and
stare
again
so
on
drifting
around
when
suddenly
gradually
all
went
out
all
that
early
April
morninglight
and
she
found
herself
in
the-
what?
who?
no!
she!
and
movement
found
herself
in
the
dark
and
if
not
exactly
insentient
insentient
for
she
could
still
hear
the
buzzing
so-called
in
the
ears
and
a
ray
of
light
came
and
went
came
and
went
such
as
the
moon
might
cast
drifting
in
and
out
of
cloud
but
so
dulled
feeling
feeling
so
dulled
she
did
not
know
what
position
she
was
in
imagine!
what
position
she
was
in!
whether
standing
or
sitting
but
the
brain-
what?
kneeling?
yes
whether
standing
or
sitting
or
kneeling
but
the
brain-
what?
lying?
yes
whether
standing
or
sitting
or
kneeling
or
lying
but
the
brain
still
still
in
a
way
for
her
first
thought
was
oh
long
after
sudden
flash
brought
up
as
she
had
been
to
believe
with
the
other
waifs
in
a
merciful
God
first
thought
was
oh
long
after
sudden
flash
she
was
being
punished
for
her
sins
a
number
of
which
then
further
proof
if
proof
were
needed
flashed
through
her
mind
one
after
another
then
dismissed
as
foolish
oh
long
after
this
thought
dismissed
as
she
suddenly
realized
gradually
realized
she
was
not
suffering
imagine!
not
suffering!
indeed
could
not
remember
off-hand
when
she
had
suffered
less
unless
of
course
she
was
meant
to
be
suffering
ha!
thought
to
be
suffering
just
as
the
odd
time
in
her
life
when
clearly
intended
to
be
having
pleasure
she
was
in
fact
having
none
not
the
slightest
in
which
case
of
course
that
notion
of
punishment
for
some
sin
or
other
or
for
the
lot
or
no
particular
reason
for
its
own
sake
thing
she
understood
perfectly
that
notion
of
punishment
which
had
first
occurred
to
her
brought
up
as
she
had
been
to
believe
with
the
other
waifs
in
a
merciful
God
first
occurred
to
her
then
dismissed
as
foolish
was
perhaps
not
so
foolish
after
all
so
on
all
that
vain
reasonings
till
another
thought
oh
long
after
sudden
flash
very
foolish
really
but-
what?
the
buzzing?
yes
all
the
time
the
buzzing
so-called
in
the
ears
though
of
course
actually
not
in
the
ears
at
all
in
the
skull
dull
roar
in
the
skull
and
all
the
time
this
ray
or
beam
like
moonbeam
but
probably
not
certainly
not
always
the
same
spot
now
bright
now
shrouded
but
always
the
same
spot
as
no
moon
could
no
no
moon
just
all
part
of
the
same
wish
to
torment
though
actually
in
point
of
fact
not
in
the
least
not
a
twinge
so
far
ha!
so
far
this
other
thought
then
oh
long
after
sudden
flash
very
foolish
really
but
so
like
her
in
a
way
that
she
might
do
well
to
groan
on
and
off
writhe
she
could
not
as
if
in
actual
agony
but
could
not
could
not
bring
herself
some
flaw
in
her
make-up
incapable
of
deceit
or
the
machine
more
likely
the
machine
so
disconnected
never
got
the
message
or
powerless
to
respond
like
numbed
couldn't
make
the
sound
not
any
sound
no
sound
of
any
kind
no
screaming
for
help
for
example
should
she
feel
so
inclined
scream
then
listen
scream
again
then
listen
again
no
spared
that
all
silent
as
the
grave
no
part-
what?
the
buzzing?
yes
all
silent
but
for
the
buzzing
so-called
no
part
of
her
moving
that
she
could
feel
just
the
eyelids
presumably
on
and
off
shut
out
the
light
reflex
they
call
it
no
feeling
of
any
kind
but
the
lids
even
best
of
times
who
feels
them?
opening
shutting
all
that
moisture
but
the
brain
still
still
sufficiently
oh
very
much
so!
at
this
stage
in
control
under
control
to
question
even
this
for
on
that
April
morning
so
it
reasoned
that
April
morning
she
fixing
with
her
eye
a
distant
bell
as
she
hastened
towards
it
fixing
it
with
her
eye
lest
it
elude
her
had
not
all
gone
out
all
that
light
of
itself
without
any
any
on
her
part
so
on
so
on
it
reasoned
vain
questionings
and
all
dead
still
sweet
silent
as
the
grave
when
suddenly
gradually
she
realiz-
what?
the
buzzing?
yes
all
dead
still
but
for
the
buzzing
when
suddenly
she
realized
words
were-
what?
who?
no!
she!
and
movement
realized
words
were
coming
imagine!
words
were
coming
a
voice
she
did
not
recognize
at
first
so
long
since
it
had
sounded
then
finally
had
to
admit
could
be
none
other
than
her
own
certain
vowel
sounds
she
had
never
heard
elsewhere
so
that
people
would
stare
the
rare
occasions
once
or
twice
a
year
always
winter
some
strange
reason
stare
at
her
uncomprehending
and
now
this
stream
steady
stream
she
who
had
never
on
the
contrary
practically
speechless
all
her
days
how
she
survived!
even

half
open
as
usual
till
it
was
back
in
her
hand
the

back
in
her
hand
then
pay
and
go
not
as
much
as
good-bye
how
she
survived!
and
now
this
stream
not
catching
the
half
of
it
not
the
quarter
no
idea
what
she
was
saying
imagine!
no
idea
what
she
was
saying!
till
she
began
trying
to
delude
herself
it
was
not
hers
at
all
not
her
voice
at
all
and
no
doubt
would
have
vital
she
should
was
on
the
point
after
long
efforts
when
suddenly
she
felt
gradually
she
felt
her
lips
moving
imagine!
her
lips
moving!
as
of
course
till
then
she
had
not
and
not
alone
the
lips
the
cheeks
the
jaws
the
whole
face
all
those-
what?
the
tongue?
yes
the
tongue
in
the
mouth
all
those
contortions
without
which
no
speech
possible
and
yet
in
the
ordinary
way
not
felt
at
all
so
intent
one
is
on
what
one
is
saying
the
whole
being
hanging
on
its
words
so
that
not
only
she
had
had
she
not
only
had
she
to
give
up
admit
hers
alone
her
voice
alone
but
this
other
awful
thought
oh
long
after
sudden
flash
even
more
awful
if
possible
that
feeling
was
coming
back
imagine!
feeling
coming
back!
starting
at
the
top
then
working
down
the
whole
machine
but
no
spared
that
the
mouth
alone
so
far
ha!
so
far
then
thinking
oh
long
after
sudden
flash
it
can't
go
on
all
this
all
that
steady
stream
straining
to
hear
make
something
of
it
and
her
own
thoughts
make
something
of
them
all-
what?
the
buzzing?
yes
all
the
time
the
buzzing
so-called
all
that
together
imagine!
whole
body
like
gone
just
the
mouth
lips
cheeks
jaws
never-
what?
tongue?
yes
lips
cheeks
jaws
tongue
never
still
a
second
mouth
on
fire
stream
of
words
in
her
ear
practically
in
her
ear
not
catching
the
half
not
the
quarter
no
idea
what
she's
saying
imagine!
no
idea
what
she's
saying!
and
can't
stop
no
stopping
it
she
who
but
a
moment
before
but
a
moment!
could
not
make
a
sound
no
sound
of
any
kind
now
can't
stop
imagine!
can't
stop
the
stream
and
the
whole
brain
begging
something
begging
in
the
brain
begging
the
mouth
to
stop
pause
a
moment
if
only
for
a
moment
and
no
response
as
if
it
hadn't
heard
or
couldn't
couldn't
pause
a
second
like
maddened
all
that
together
straining
to
hear
piece
it
together
and
the
brain
raving
away
on
its
own
trying
to
make
sense
of
it
or
make
it
stop
or
in
the
past
dragging
up
the
past
flashes
from
all
over
walks
mostly
walking
all
her
days
day
after
day
a
few
steps
then
stop
stare
into
space
then
on
a
few
more
stop
and
stare
again
so
on
drifting
around
day
after
day
or
that
time
she
cried
the
one
time
she
could
remember
since
she
was
a
baby
must
have
cried
as
a
baby
perhaps
not
not
essential
to
life
just
the
birth
cry
to
get
her
going
breathing
then
no
more
till
this
old
hag
already
sitting
staring
at
her
hand
where
was
it?
Croker's
Acres
one
evening
on
the
way
home
home!
a
little
mound
in
Croker's
Acres
dusk
sitting
staring
at
her
hand
there
in
her
lap
palm
upward
suddenly
saw
it
wet
the
palm
tears
hers
presumably
no
one
else
for
miles
no
sound
just
the
tears
sat
and
watched
them
dry
all
over
in
a
second
or
grabbing
at
straw
the
brain
flickering
away
on
its
own
quick
grab
and
on
nothing
there
on
to
the
next
bad
as
the
voice
worse
as
little
sense
all
that
together
can't-
what?
the
buzzing?
yes
all
the
time
the
buzzing
dull
roar
like
falls
and
the
beam
flickering
on
and
off
starting
to
move
around
like
moonbeam
but
not
all
part
of
the
same
keep
an
eye
on
that
too
corner
of
the
eye
all
that
together
can't
go
on
God
is
love
she'll
be
purged
back
in
the
field
morning
sun
April
sink
face
down
in
the
grass
nothing
but
the
larks
so
on
grabbing
at
the
straw
straining
to
hear
the
odd
word
make
some
sense
of
it
whole
body
like
gone
just
the
mouth
like
maddened
and
can't
stop
no
stopping
it
something
she-
something
she
had
to-
what?
who?
no!
she!
and
movement
something
she
had
to-
what?
the
buzzing?
yes
all
the
time
the
buzzing
dull
roar
in
the
skull
and
the

ferreting
around
painless
so
far
ha!
so
far
then
thinking
oh
long
after
sudden
flash
perhaps
something
she
had
to
had
to

something
she
had
to

tiny
little

before
its

godforsaken

no

spared
that
speechless
all
her
days
practically
speechless
how

that

in

what

she
to

for
herself
guilty

not
guilty
stand
up
woman

up

there
staring
into

mouth
half
open
as

waiting
to

away
glad
of

on

now
this

she
had
to

could
that

something
that

yes
something

good
