she!_246.525
PAUSE_247.800
found herself in the dark_249.670
and if not exactly insentient_251.350
insentient_252.274
for she could still hear the buzzing_253.635
so-called_254.450
in the ears_255.145
and a ray of light came and went_257.000
came and went_257.778
such as the moon might cast
drifting
in and out of cloud
but so dulled
feeling
feeling so dulled
she did not know
what position she was in
imagine!
what position she was in!
whether standing
or sitting
but the brain–
what?
kneeling?
yes
whether standing
or sitting
or kneeling
but the brain–
what?
lying?
yes
whether standing
or sitting
or kneeling
or lying
but the brain still
still
in a way
for her first thought was
oh long after
sudden flash
brought up as she had been to believe
with the other waifs
in a merciful
LAUGH
God
LAUGH!
first thought was
oh long after
sudden flash
she was being punished
for her sins
a number of which then
further proof if proof were needed
flashed through her mind
one after another
then dismissed as foolish
oh long after
this thought dismissed
as she suddenly realized
gradually realized
she was not suffering
imagine!
not suffering!
indeed could not remember
off-hand
when she had suffered less
unless of course she was
meant to be suffering
ha!
thought to be suffering
just as the odd time
in her life
when clearly intended to be having pleasure
she was in fact
having none
not the slightest
in which case of course
that notion of punishment
for some sin or other
or for the lot
or no particular reason
for its own sake
thing she understood perfectly
that notion of punishment
which had first occurred to her
brought up as she had been to believe
with the other waifs
in a merciful
LAUGH
God
LAUGH!
first occurred to her
then dismissed
as foolish
was perhaps not so foolish
after all
so on
all that
vain reasonings
till another thought
oh long after
sudden flash
very foolish really but–
what?
the buzzing?
yes
all the time the buzzing
so-called
in the ears
though of course actually
not in the ears at all
in the skull
dull roar in the skull
and all the time this ray or beam
like moonbeam
but probably not
certainly not
always the same spot
now bright
now shrouded
but always the same spot
as no moon could
no
no moon
just all part of the same wish to
torment
though actually in point of fact
not in the least
not a twinge
so far
ha!
so far
this other thought then
oh long after
sudden flash
very foolish really but so like her
in a way
that she might do well to
groan
on and off
writhe she could not
as if in actual agony
but could not
could not bring herself
some flaw in her make-up
incapable of deceit
or the machine
more likely the machine
so disconnected
never got the message
or powerless to respond
like numbed
couldn't make the sound
not any sound
no sound of any kind
no screaming for help for example
should she feel so inclined
scream
SCREAM
then listen
PAUSE
scream again
SCREAM
then listen again
PAUSE
no
spared that
all silent as the grave
no part–
what?
the buzzing?
yes
all silent but for the buzzing
so-called
no part of her moving
that she could feel
just the eyelids
presumably
on and off
shut out the light
reflex they call it
no feeling of any kind
but the lids
even best of times
who feels them?
opening
shutting
all that moisture
but the brain still
still sufficiently
oh very much so!
at this stage
in control
under control
to question even this
for on that April morning
so it reasoned
that April morning
she fixing with her eye
a distant bell
as she hastened towards it
fixing it with her eye
lest it elude her
had not all gone out
all that light
of itself
without any
any
on her part
so on
so on it reasoned
vain questionings
and all dead still
sweet silent as the grave
when suddenly
gradually
she realiz–
what?
the buzzing?
yes
all dead still but for the buzzing
when suddenly she realized
words were–
what?
who?
no!
she!
PAUSE
realized
words were coming
imagine!
words were coming
a voice she did not recognize
at first
so long since it had sounded
then finally had to admit
could be none other
than her own
certain vowel sounds
she had never heard
elsewhere
so that people would stare
the rare occasions
once or twice a year
always winter some strange reason
stare at her uncomprehending
and now this stream
steady stream
she who had never
on the contrary
practically speechless
all her days
how she survived!
even shopping
out shopping
busy shopping centre
supermart
just hand in the list
with the bag
old black shopping bag
then stand there waiting
any length of time
middle of the throng
motionless
staring into space
mouth half open as usual
till it was back in her hand
the bag back in her hand
then pay and go
not as much as good-bye
how she survived!
and now this stream
not catching the half of it
not the quarter
no idea
what she was saying
imagine!
no idea what she was saying!
till she began trying to
delude herself
it was not hers at all
not her voice at all
and no doubt would have
vital she should
was on the point
after long efforts
when suddenly she felt
gradually she felt
her lips moving
imagine!
her lips moving!
as of course till then she had not
and not alone the lips
the cheeks
the jaws
the whole face
all those–
what?
the tongue?
yes
the tongue in the mouth
all those contortions without which
no speech possible
and yet in the ordinary way
not felt at all
so intent one is
on what one is saying
the whole being
hanging on its words
so that not only she had
had she
not only had she
to give up
admit hers alone
her voice alone
but this other awful thought
oh long after
sudden flash
even more awful if possible
that feeling was coming back
imagine!
feeling coming back!
starting at the top
then working down
the whole machine
but no
spared that
the mouth alone
so far
ha!
so far
then thinking
oh long after
sudden flash
it can't go on
all this
all that
steady stream
straining to hear
make something of it
and her own thoughts
make something of them
all–
what?
the buzzing?
yes
all the time the buzzing
so-called
all that together
imagine!
whole body like gone
just the mouth
lips
cheeks
jaws
never–
what?
tongue?
yes
lips
cheeks
jaws
tongue
never still a second
mouth on fire
stream of words
in her ear
practically in her ear
not catching the half
not the quarter
no idea what she's saying
imagine!
no idea what she's saying!
and can't stop
no stopping it
she who but a moment before
but a moment!
could not make a sound
no sound of any kind
now can't stop
imagine!
can't stop the stream
and the whole brain begging
something begging in the brain
begging the mouth to stop
pause a moment
if only for a moment
and no response
as if it hadn't heard
or couldn't
couldn't pause a second
like maddened
all that together
straining to hear
piece it together
and the brain
raving away on its own
trying to make sense of it
or make it stop
or in the past
dragging up the past
flashes from all over
walks mostly
walking all her days
day after day
a few steps then stop
stare into space
then on
a few more
stop and stare again
so on
drifting around
day after day
or that time she cried
the one time she could remember
since she was a baby
must have cried as a baby
perhaps not
not essential to life
just the birth cry to get her going
breathing
then no more till this
old hag already
sitting staring at her hand
where was it?
Croker's Acres
one evening on the way home
home!
a little mound in Croker's Acres
dusk
sitting staring at her hand
there in her lap
palm upward
suddenly saw it wet
the palm
tears presumably
hers presumably
no one else for miles
no sound
just the tears
sat and watched them dry
all over in a second
or grabbing at straw
the brain
flickering away on its own
quick grab and on
nothing there
on to the next
bad as the voice
worse
as little sense
all that together
can't–
what?
the buzzing?
yes
all the time the buzzing
dull roar like falls
and the beam
flickering on and off
starting to move around
like moonbeam but not
all part of the same
keep an eye on that too
corner of the eye
all that together
can't go on
God is love
she'll be purged
back in the field
morning sun
April
sink face down in the grass
nothing but the larks
so on
grabbing at the straw
straining to hear
the odd word
make some sense of it
whole body like gone
just the mouth
like maddened
and can't stop
no stopping it
something she–
something she had to–
what?
who?
no!
she!
PAUSE
something she had to–
what?
the buzzing?
yes
all the time the buzzing
dull roar
in the skull
and the beam
ferreting around
painless
so far
ha!
so far
then thinking
oh long after
sudden flash
perhaps something she had to
had to
tell
could that be it?
something she had to
tell
tiny little thing
before its time
godforsaken hole
no love
spared that
speechless all her days
practically speechless
how she survived!
that time in court
what had she to say for herself
guilty or not guilty
stand up woman
speak up woman
stood there staring into space
mouth half open as usual
waiting to be led away
glad of the hand on her arm
now this
something she had to tell
could that be it?
something that would tell
how it was
how she–
what?
had been?
yes
something that would tell how it had been
how she had lived
lived on and on
guilty or not
on and on
to be sixty
something she–
what?
seventy?
good God!
on and on to be seventy
something she didn't know herself
wouldn't know if she heard
then forgiven
God is love
tender mercies
new every morning
back in the field
April morning
face in the grass
nothing but the larks
pick it up there
get on with it from there
another few–
what?
not that?
nothing to do with that?
nothing she could tell?
all right
nothing she could tell
try something else
think of something else
oh long after
sudden flash
not that either
all right
something else again
so on
hit on it in the end
think everything keep on long enough
then forgiven
back in the–
what?
not that either?
nothing to do with that either?
nothing she could think?
all right
nothing she could tell
nothing she could think
nothing she–
what?
who?
no!
she!
PAUSE
tiny little thing
out before its time
godforsaken hole
no love
spared that
speechless all her days
practically speechless
even to herself
never out loud
but not completely
sometimes sudden urge
once or twice a year
always winter some strange reason
the long evenings
hours of darkness
sudden urge to
tell
then rush out stop the first she saw
nearest lavatory
start pouring it out
steady stream
mad stuff
half the vowels wrong
no one could follow
till she saw the stare she was getting
then die of shame
crawl back in
once or twice a year
always winter some strange reason
long hours of darkness
now this
this
quicker and quicker
the words
the brain
flickering away like mad
quick grab and on
nothing there
on somewhere else
try somewhere else
all the time something begging
something in her begging
begging it all to stop
unanswered
prayer unanswered
or unheard
too faint
so on
keep on
trying
not knowing what
what she was trying
what to try
whole body like gone
just the mouth
like maddened
so on
keep–
what?
the buzzing?
yes
all the time the buzzing
dull roar like falls
in the skull
and the beam
poking around
painless
so far
ha!
so far
all that
keep on
not knowing what
what she was–
what?
who?
no!
she!
SHE!
PAUSE
what she was trying
what to try
no matter
keep on
[Curtain starts down.]
hit on it in the end
then back
God is love
tender mercies
new every morning
back in the field
April morning
face in the grass
nothing but the larks
pick it up–
